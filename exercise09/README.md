## Problem description
If you got to here, compliments! This is the final challenge. Here
you are tasked to modify the script of the [previous exercise](../exercise08/ex08_solution.py) and 
adapt it to perform a HF calculation in methane.

There are two things you need to modify to accomplish this goal:
1. Automatically loop over the nuclei (previously, this was hardcoded to
   only two nuclei)
2. Change the geometry of the input molecule

Good luck!

If you got this far, your script should by now be sufficiently general
that you can also start simulating other (simple) molecules such as
BF3, benzene and the likes. Have fun!

## Solution
The solution is given in [ex09_solution.py](ex09_solution.py)
